This program used to lenna ai test
<br>
<br>

I want to start by expressing my gratitude for giving me the time and chance to take the exam on Lenna AI.
<br>
<br>

One of my Laravel applications, with several issues. I am presenting this application from recently.
<br>
<br>

This application took me around three days to finish. Starting on October 21, 2022, I'm going to have to re-learn how to utilize Laravel.
<br>
<li>Laravel (Backend PHP Framework)</li>
<br>
<li>Vue.js (Frontend Javascript Framework)</li>
<br>
<li>laravel-echo (Capture pusher-sent events)</li>
<br>
<li>Pusher (Real-time web-socket connection)</li>
<br>
<br>

<p>Run composer install / composer update </p>
<br>

<p>Run npm install to install all package </p>
<br>

<p>Run npm run dev / npm run watch (for these two commands are fundamentally distinct, although you'll later build laravel mix)</p>
<br>

﻿# <b> Don't forget to check the .env file section</b>
 <br>
<b>And</b>
<br>
<b>You can look at the config file if necessary.#</b>
 
<H2> Thank you ^^, </H2>
